# Basic week planner
Useful for basic planning really quickly, especially for the lazy and time confined. Just keep it simple. Only tested on Ubuntu 24.04 with Gnome colors used in the css file. Dependencies listed in INSTALL.md, though I might have missed some.

# Features
- Plan seven days ahead, and keep track of overdue or past items for only three days.
- Drag and drop items from one day to another.
- persistant tracking between sessions by saving to a json file.
- GTK through Python for a semi native feel on Ubuntu.
- Highlighting through in text markers such as !! at the start of a entry
